# SmartWaterTap
This is my third year first semester project 
The project concerns with the following:
"An  often ignored or rather  unnoticed wastage of water occurs during the process of filling the containers . The amount seems to be very negligible on the part of an individual but this ‘invisible’ wastage contributes a big role in the water scarcity problem when done by a population of 7,632,819,325: the entire human species on the earth. The project addresses this problem with a solution of automating the process."
